# Forged in Fiendship
A fiendish modpack for all your friendly fiends.

## Mods under consideration
These mods are under consideration for the fear of instability/incompatibility.
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ksyxis
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alternate-current
- Lucent + Hardcore Torches, might provide a cool "hardcore" experience.

World gen that might be too much.
- When Dungeons Arise

Future interest.

## Mods waiting update
- ~~YUNG's mods~~
- Tetra
- Thaumcraft
- Infernal Expansion

## TODO
- Fix I Like Wood's config
- Find a way to include [shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders/files/3685089)
- Add config files.
- Auto disable flywheel when using shaders
- Rubidium (Sodium) and Oculus (Iris): No CTM and bugs with "Snow real magic" and others.
- Consider use of Optifine vs the above. Optifine is probably slower, but has more compatibility.
